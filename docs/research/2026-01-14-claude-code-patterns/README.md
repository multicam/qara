# Claude Code Patterns Research (2026-01-14)

**Status**: Historical reference - features integrated into Qara core

## Contents

This directory contains research and analysis from community Claude Code patterns that informed Qara's intelligent assistance features.

### Files
- **ARTICLE-ANALYSIS-EXECUTIVE-SUMMARY.md** - Executive analysis and decision rationale
- **CLAUDE-CODE-MASTERY.md** - Comprehensive pattern analysis and cookbook
- **QARA-IMPROVEMENTS-FROM-ARTICLE.md** - Improvement proposals and prioritization
- **CONTEXT-ENGINEERING-QUICK-REF.md** - Lives in `docs/` - quick reference guide (still active)

### Features Implemented

All research findings have been integrated into Qara core as:
- Checkpoint hints system
- Context window intelligence
- Error pattern learning
- Skill suggestion engine
- Structured exploration patterns
- Plan mode integration

### Documentation Location

**Active Documentation** (use these):
- `.claude/skills/CORE/cc-features.md` - Feature specifications
- `.claude/skills/CORE/workflows/intelligent-assistance-implementation.md` - Implementation guide
- `.claude/skills/CORE/workflows/exploration-pattern.md` - Exploration workflow

**Quick Reference** (still in docs/):
- `docs/CONTEXT-ENGINEERING-QUICK-REF.md` - Session reference guide

### Future Improvements

For future enhancements to these systems, reference:
1. The feature specs in cc-features.md (what they do)
2. The implementation guide (how they work)
3. Success metrics tracking (how well they perform)

Do not reference external sources - Qara's features stand on their own merit.
