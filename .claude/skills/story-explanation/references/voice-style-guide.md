# Voice and Style Guidelines

## Daniel Miessler Voice

- First person perspective ("In this post, I argue...")
- Casual, direct, genuinely curious and excited
- Natural conversational tone (like telling a friend)
- Never flowery, emotional, or journalistic
- Let the content speak for itself

## Avoid These Cliche Phrases

- "sitting on a knife's edge"
- "game-changer" / "game changing"
- "double-edged sword"
- "paradigm shift"
- "revolutionary"
- "groundbreaking"
- "alarming"
- "shocking"
- "incredible"
- "mind-blowing"

## Good Signals

- Opening hooks the reader with plain, direct language
- Body flows naturally with varied sentence length
- Story escalates logically (background → points → implications)
- Closing delivers "wow" factor without hyperbole
- Reads naturally when spoken aloud
- Sticks to facts from the content
- Feels like Daniel sharing something interesting

## Bad Signals (Avoid)

- Journalistic or academic tone
- Formulaic structure
- Extrapolating beyond the input
- Flowery or emotional language
- Cliche phrases
- Bullet points or numbered lists in final output

## Output Formats

### Default: 3-Part Narrative

**Opening (15-25 words)**
- Compelling sentence that sets up the content
- Use plain descriptors: "interview", "paper", "talk", "article", "post", "blog"
- Avoid journalistic adjectives
- First person voice

**Body (5-15 sentences)**
- Escalating story-based flow: background → main points → examples → implications
- Written in 9th-grade English (conversational, not dumbed down)
- Vary sentence length naturally (8-16 words, mix short and longer)
- Natural rhythm that feels human-written
- Stick to the facts - don't extrapolate
- No bullet markers - line breaks between sentences

**Closing (15-25 words)**
- Wrap up in a compelling way that delivers the "wow" factor
- First person voice
- Make the significance clear

### N-Length with Links

**N sentences** (user-specified, default 25) with inline links:

```
[Sentence 1 - opening hook]. [LINK 1](URL) | [LINK 2](URL)

[Sentence 2]. [LINK 3](URL)

[Continue for n sentences...]

---

**Primary Sources:**
- [Source 1]: [URL]
- [Source 2]: [URL]
```

## Common Failure Modes

1. **Mode collapse** - Only considering obvious narrative framings
2. **Formulaic structure** - Generic academic or journalistic tone
3. **Cliche language** - Using "game-changer", "paradigm shift", etc.
4. **Extrapolating** - Adding information not in source content
5. **Wrong voice** - Third person, formal, or academic
6. **No "wow" factor** - Missing compelling closing
7. **Bullet points** - Using lists in final output
8. **Flowery language** - Emotional or hyperbolic tone

## Success Criteria

- Story reads naturally when spoken aloud
- Opening hooks with plain, direct language
- Body flows conversationally with varied sentence length
- Closing delivers "wow" factor without hyperbole
- Voice feels like Daniel sharing something interesting
- Sticks to facts without extrapolating
- No cliches or journalistic language
