## Intelligent Assistance Features (2026-01-14)

Qara's proactive assistance systems for safer operations, better visibility, and faster error resolution:

### Safety & Reliability Features
1. **Checkpoint Hints** - Proactive safety reminders before destructive operations
   - PreToolUse hook monitors 13 high-risk patterns (rm -rf, git reset --hard, DROP TABLE, kubectl delete, etc.)
   - Suggests checkpoint creation if >5 minutes since last checkpoint
   - State tracking: `.claude/state/last-checkpoint.json`
   - Target: 95% checkpoint coverage on risky operations

2. **Context Window Intelligence** - Real-time visibility into effective context usage
   - Status line displays usage against effective budget (60% of stated 1M capacity)
   - Color-coded indicators: ✅ Green (0-60%), ⚠️ Yellow (60-80%), 🚨 Red (80%+)
   - Prevents context degradation through early warning
   - Target: 75% reduction in context-related issues

### Learning & Discovery Features
3. **Error Pattern Learning** - Institutional knowledge accumulation for faster problem resolution
   - Automatically logs errors to JSONL database with normalized codes
   - Suggests known solutions when similar errors recur
   - Seed patterns: ENOENT, TS2339, MODULE_NOT_FOUND, HTTP errors, git conflicts
   - State: `.claude/state/error-patterns.jsonl`, Library: `.claude/hooks/lib/error-patterns.ts`
   - Target: 30% reduction in error resolution time

4. **Skill Suggestion Engine** - Context-aware feature discovery
   - Analyzes current project context (package.json, session notes, directory structure)
   - Proactively suggests relevant skills at session start
   - 8 skill mappings covering web scraping, research, UI design, CLI tools, PAI optimization
   - Non-intrusive console display
   - Target: Shift from reactive to proactive skill usage

### Workflow Optimization Features
5. **Structured Exploration Pattern** - Systematic codebase understanding
   - Workflow routing: "explore codebase" → 3-agent parallel exploration
   - Documented pattern: codebase-locator + pattern-finder + analyzer + spotcheck synthesis
   - Located: `.claude/skills/CORE/workflows/exploration-pattern.md`

6. **Plan Mode Integration** - Formalized complex task handling
   - Workflow routing: "plan this out" → /plan mode with create_plan → implement_plan → validate_plan
   - Structured approach for multi-file changes and architectural decisions

## Upgrade Path

When new CC versions release:

1. Check CHANGELOG at `https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md`
2. Run `/cc-pai-optimiser` to audit against new features
3. Update this document with adoption status

## Success Metrics

Track for 2 weeks after 2026-01-14 implementation:

- **Checkpoint Usage**: 60% → 95% (before risky operations)
- **Context Issues**: 2/week → 0.5/week (75% reduction)
- **Error Iterations**: 5-7 → 3-4 (30% reduction)
- **Skill Discovery**: Reactive → Proactive
