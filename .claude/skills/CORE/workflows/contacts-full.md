# Complete Contact Directory

**Purpose**: This file consolidates all contact information. 

**Note**: This is a reference to the main contacts file to avoid duplication.

## See Main Contact File

**Primary contact information is maintained in:**
`${PAI_DIR}/skills/CORE/contacts.md`

That file contains:
- Primary contacts
- Work colleagues  
- Friends & family
- Pronunciation guides
- Social media handles
- Communication preferences
- Emergency contacts

---

## Why This Separation?

Originally planned as separate "full" vs "abbreviated" contact lists, but:
- Duplication creates sync issues
- Single source of truth is better
- Main contacts.md already comprehensive

**Recommendation**: Use `contacts.md` as the single canonical contact directory.

## Migration Note

If you have contacts that should be in the system:
1. Add them to `~/.claude/skills/CORE/contacts.md`
2. Follow the structure defined there
3. Keep pronunciation guides up to date
