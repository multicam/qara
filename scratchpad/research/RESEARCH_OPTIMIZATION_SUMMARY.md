# Research Optimization Plan - Executive Summary

**Date:** December 1, 2025  
**Full Plan:** [RESEARCH_OPTIMIZATION_PLAN.md](RESEARCH_OPTIMIZATION_PLAN.md)  
**Status:** Ready for Implementation

---

## Overview

Comprehensive plan to transform the already-excellent research skill (Grade A+) into a world-class research system using proven CORE refactor methodology.

---

## Current State Analysis

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Grade A+ (best in system)
- ✅ Zero redundancy (2,262 lines, 0% waste)
- ✅ 5-10x faster than sequential research
