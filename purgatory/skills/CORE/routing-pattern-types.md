## Routing Patterns

Three distinct routing patterns emerge from production skills, plus a critical fourth pattern for cross-skill delegation.

---

## Pattern 1: Semantic Routing

**How it works:** Semantic matching of user intent to specific workflow files (not rigid keyword matching)

**Best for:** Skills with distinct capabilities that map to different user intents

**CRITICAL:** Skills must contain **explicit routing instructions** that map user intent patterns to specific workflow files with full file paths. Use semantic understanding, not just exact keyword matches.

**Example: security-OSINT skill**

```markdown
## Workflow Routing

**When user requests person/individual research:**
Examples: "do OSINT on [person]", "research [person]", "background check on [person]", "who is [person]", "find info about [person]", "investigate this person"
→ **READ:** ${PAI_DIR}/skills/security-OSINT/workflows/people/lookup.md
→ **EXECUTE:** Complete person OSINT workflow

**When user requests company due diligence:**
Examples: "due diligence on [company]", "check out [company] before partnership", "vet [company]", "should we work with [company]", "is [company] legitimate"
→ **READ:** ${PAI_DIR}/skills/security-OSINT/workflows/company/due-diligence.md
→ **EXECUTE:** Comprehensive company due diligence workflow

**When user requests company research (general):**
Examples: "do OSINT on [company]", "research [company]", "company intelligence on [company]", "what can you find about [company]", "look up [company]"
→ **READ:** ${PAI_DIR}/skills/security-OSINT/workflows/company/lookup.md
→ **EXECUTE:** Complete company OSINT workflow

**When user requests entity/domain investigation:**
Examples: "investigate [domain]", "threat intelligence on [entity]", "is this domain malicious", "research this threat actor", "look up [domain]"
→ **READ:** ${PAI_DIR}/skills/security-OSINT/workflows/entity/lookup.md
→ **EXECUTE:** Complete entity OSINT workflow
```

**Routing Flow:**
```
User: "Check out Acme Corp before we partner with them"
    ↓
Level 1: Semantic match ("check out...before partnership") → Activates security-OSINT skill
    ↓
Level 2: Loads SKILL.md, activation conditions match
    ↓
Level 3: Semantic understanding (vetting/validation intent) → Routes to company due diligence
    ↓
Level 4: READ ${PAI_DIR}/skills/security-OSINT/workflows/company/due-diligence.md
    ↓
EXECUTE workflow steps
```

**Implementation (MANDATORY):**
1. **Place routing section AT THE TOP** of SKILL.md (immediately after header, before any other content)
2. **Title it "Workflow Routing (SYSTEM PROMPT)"** to indicate this is critical routing logic
3. **Define user intent categories** (not just keyword lists) - describe what user wants
4. **Provide example phrases** showing natural language variations (5-10 examples per intent)
5. **Specify exact workflow file path** to READ (absolute path required)
6. **State the action** to take (READ and EXECUTE workflow)
7. **Use arrow notation (→)** to show: user intent → file path → action
8. **Include all workflow files** - every workflow needs explicit routing rule
9. **Emphasize semantic matching** - agent should understand intent, not just match keywords

**CRITICAL PLACEMENT:** This routing section must be the FIRST thing in the skill content (after YAML frontmatter and title) so Claude sees it immediately when the skill loads. Think of it as the "system prompt" for the skill itself.

**Why This Matters:**
- Without explicit routing, Claude may guess or spin up generic research/interns instead
- Semantic matching handles natural language variations ("check out before partnership" = "due diligence")
- Makes workflow selection deterministic based on user intent
- Prevents skill activation without proper workflow execution
- Enables proper Level 4 routing to specific workflow files

---

## Pattern 2: State-Based Routing

**How it works:** Routing decisions based on current task state or development phase

**Best for:** Process-driven skills with sequential workflows (e.g., spec → implement → test)

**Example: development skill**

```markdown
## Spec-Driven Development Workflow

### Phase 1: Specification
**Current State:** No spec exists
**Use:** sdd-specify.md to create feature specification

### Phase 2: Planning
**Current State:** Spec exists, no implementation plan
**Use:** sdd-plan.md to break down into tasks

### Phase 3: Implementation
**Current State:** Plan exists, ready to code
**Use:** sdd-implement.md for TDD execution

### Phase 4: Validation
**Current State:** Implementation complete
**Use:** validate-mvp.md to verify requirements
```

**Routing Flow:**
```
User: "Implement the user authentication feature"
    ↓
Level 1: Matches "implement" → Activates development skill
    ↓
Level 2: Loads SKILL.md, checks task state
    ↓
Level 3: No spec exists → Routes to Phase 1 (Specification)
    ↓
Level 4: Loads sdd-specify.md → Creates spec first
    ↓
(After spec complete) Routes to Phase 2 → sdd-plan.md
    ↓
(After plan complete) Routes to Phase 3 → sdd-implement.md
```

**Implementation:**
1. Define clear state transitions (what exists, what's next)
2. Check for prerequisite artifacts (specs, plans, tests)
3. Route to earliest incomplete phase
4. Provide state transition guidance in SKILL.md

## Pattern 3: Agent-Delegated Routing

**How it works:** Skill provides context and capabilities, agent makes intelligent routing decisions

**Best for:** Complex skills with many possible workflows where context determines best path

**Example: system skill**

```markdown
## Available Capabilities

### Website Management
- get-analytics.md - Fetch Cloudflare analytics
- search-content.md - Search published content
- sync-content.md - Sync content to vector database
- troubleshoot-cloudflare.md - Debug deployment issues

### Security
- check-sensitive.md - Scan for exposed secrets
- security-scan.md - Run security audit

### Observability
- observability/update-dashboard.md - Update monitoring dashboard
- observability/check-metrics.md - View system metrics

### Configuration
- create-cloudflare-integration.md - Create new Cloudflare integration
- update-qara-repo.md - Commit and push changes
```

**Routing Flow:**
```
User: "The blog post isn't showing up on the website"
    ↓
Level 1: Matches "website" → Activates system skill
    ↓
Level 2: Loads SKILL.md, presents all website capabilities
    ↓
Level 3: Agent analyzes problem (deployment issue)
    ↓
Level 4: Agent chooses troubleshoot-cloudflare.md (most relevant)
    ↓
Execution (may chain to sync-content.md if needed)
```

**Implementation:**
1. Organize workflows into clear capability categories
2. Provide descriptive workflow names and purposes
3. Trust agent to select most appropriate workflow
4. Enable workflow chaining for multi-step solutions

---

## Pattern 4: Cross-Skill Delegation (CRITICAL)

**How it works:** One skill recognizes a request is better handled by another skill and IMMEDIATELY delegates via Skill tool invocation

**Best for:** Skills with overlapping trigger domains where specialized skills provide better execution

**CRITICAL IMPORTANCE:** This pattern prevents routing errors where the agent activates a skill but fails to delegate to the correct specialized skill when needed.

**Example: research skill delegating to security-OSINT skill**

```markdown
## Workflow Routing (SYSTEM PROMPT)

**CRITICAL: Check if request should be delegated to specialized skills FIRST, before activating research workflows.**

**When user requests due diligence, comprehensive company research, or background checks:**
Examples: "due diligence on [company]", "do due diligence", "comprehensive research on [company/person]", "vet [company]", "background check on [person]", "investigate [company/person]"
→ **INVOKE SKILL:** security-OSINT
→ **REASON:** Due diligence and comprehensive entity research require OSINT methodology with technical reconnaissance, not just web research

**Otherwise, proceed with research skill workflows below.**
```

**Routing Flow:**
```
User: "I need due diligence on Rise Capital"
    ↓
Level 1: Matches "due diligence" OR "research" → Activates research skill
    ↓
Level 2: Research skill SKILL.md loads
    ↓
Level 3: IMMEDIATE CHECK: Does "due diligence" match delegation rule?
    ↓
YES → DELEGATE: Invoke security-OSINT skill (Skill tool)
    ↓
Security-OSINT skill activates with full context
    ↓
Security-OSINT routes to due-diligence.md workflow
    ↓
Execution with proper OSINT methodology
```

**WITHOUT Cross-Skill Delegation (FAILURE MODE):**
```
User: "I need due diligence on Rise Capital"
    ↓
Level 1: Matches "research" → Activates research skill
    ↓
Level 2: Research skill loads, sees "research" request
    ↓
Level 3: Routes to general research workflows
    ↓
Level 4: Launches researcher agents (wrong approach)
    ↓
FAILURE: Missing specialized OSINT methodology, domain discovery, technical recon
```

**Implementation (MANDATORY for Skills with Delegation):**

1. **Place delegation section FIRST** in SKILL.md (immediately after header, before any other content)
2. **Title it "Workflow Routing (SYSTEM PROMPT)"** to indicate critical routing logic
3. **Check delegation BEFORE proceeding** to internal workflows
4. **Use semantic pattern matching** (not just keywords) - understand user intent
5. **Explicitly INVOKE the specialized skill** using Skill tool
6. **Provide clear reasoning** for why delegation is required
7. **Examples must be comprehensive** - cover all variations of user phrasing

**Template for Delegation Section:**

```markdown
## Workflow Routing (SYSTEM PROMPT)

**CRITICAL: Check if request should be delegated to specialized skills FIRST, before activating [this-skill] workflows.**

**When user requests [specific use case that needs delegation]:**
Examples: "[phrase 1]", "[phrase 2]", "[phrase 3]", "[phrase 4]", "[phrase 5]"
→ **INVOKE SKILL:** [specialized-skill-name]
→ **REASON:** [Why the specialized skill is required - specific capabilities it provides]

**When user requests [another use case needing delegation]:**
Examples: "[phrase 1]", "[phrase 2]", "[phrase 3]"
→ **INVOKE SKILL:** [another-specialized-skill]
→ **REASON:** [Why this delegation is needed]

**Otherwise, proceed with [this-skill] workflows below.**

---

[Rest of SKILL.md continues normally]
```

**Real-World Examples of Cross-Skill Delegation:**

**Example 1: research → security-OSINT**
- **Trigger:** "due diligence", "background check", "comprehensive company research"
- **Why:** OSINT methodology includes domain discovery, technical recon, investment-specific vetting
- **Result:** Proper 5-phase due diligence with quality gates

**Example 2: system → development**
- **Trigger:** "add feature to observability dashboard", "implement new workflow"
- **Why:** Feature development requires spec-driven development and TDD methodology
- **Result:** Proper specification, planning, implementation with tests

**Example 3: business → security-OSINT**
- **Trigger:** "vet potential client", "research consulting prospect"
- **Why:** Client vetting requires comprehensive background checks and OSINT
- **Result:** Due diligence before accepting consulting engagement

**When to Use Cross-Skill Delegation:**

✅ **USE DELEGATION WHEN:**
- Specialized skill has comprehensive methodology the general skill lacks
- Request matches specific use case requiring technical expertise
- General skill would produce incomplete or incorrect results
- Specialized skill has quality gates and validation that ensure completeness

❌ **DON'T USE DELEGATION WHEN:**
- General skill workflows are sufficient
- No specialized methodology required
- Cross-skill invocation adds unnecessary complexity
- Both skills would produce equivalent results

**Why This Pattern Is Critical:**

1. **Prevents routing failures** - Ensures requests reach the RIGHT skill, not just A skill
2. **Maintains expertise boundaries** - Specialized skills have domain-specific workflows
3. **Ensures methodology compliance** - Specialized skills have quality gates and validation
4. **Reduces duplication** - One comprehensive implementation instead of multiple partial ones
5. **Makes routing deterministic** - Clear rules prevent agent confusion

**Failure Mode Prevention:**

The Rise Capital due diligence failure (2025-11-12) occurred because:
- User requested "due diligence on Rise Capital"
- research skill activated (correct Level 1 routing)
- BUT research skill did NOT delegate to security-OSINT (missing Level 3 routing)
- Result: Generic research instead of comprehensive OSINT methodology
- Consequence: Missed risecapital.partners domain and investor-facing content

**This pattern prevents that failure mode by making delegation EXPLICIT and FIRST.**
